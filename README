Compiling instructions
----------------------

To compile, enter:
	make
To clean up, enter:
	make clean

Execution instructions
----------------------

Before execution, make sure the server and client are both connecting on
computers on the same network, and that you know the IP of the server.
To check for the server's IP, in a Terminal, use "ifconfig". In Unix/Linux,
it should be under eth0 or wlan0, as the "inet addr". The whole number and
the periods are needed when connecting to a server (first option) on the
main menu. Example: 127.0.0.1 is a valid IP if the server is on the same
computer; 197.128.175.231 is also a valid IP address.

To run, use three Terminals (preferrably on two computers).
In the first Terminal (Server), enter:
	./2cities-server
In the second Terminal (Player One), enter:
	./2cities-client [-pretty | -fullscreen]

		-pretty: Enables extra bloom and shader effects; this
		flag is built for higher-end machines.

		-fullscreen: Runs the game in full screen mode.

In the third Terminal (Player Two), enter the same as for the second Terminal.
